In this project we took the data by using web scrapping. We took reliance stock market data for price prediction and done with EDA process and data visualization.
After that we used forecasting model like prophet, Arima model, Sarimax model to check the accuracy and error(Mean Squared Error).
At last done with model deployment on the Reliance Stock Market data using prophet model as a result it will show the predicted price for specific date.
And as a result if user enter a date then it will show the price for that date for Reliance Stock market data.
